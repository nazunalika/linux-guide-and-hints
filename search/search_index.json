It's a system that can be loosely compared to Active Directory in what it attempts to solve for Linux and UNIX clients and even mixed environments. While it is not an active directory, it is an integrated Identity and Authentication solution for Linux/UNIX environments, which means it does not support Windows clients. One problem that FreeIPA attempts to solve is giving back control to the Linux/UNIX administration teams of access, authentication, and authorization rather than trying to integrate directly into Active Directory, where the controls do not work the same or do not work at all. And because of this, no third party software is required to be installed.</p>"},{"location":"el/freeipa/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>Here are the list of requirements below.</p> <ul> <li>Enterprise Linux 9+ or Fedora Linux</li> <li>An active internet connection to install the packages required or   available internal mirrors</li> <li>2 core, 4GB system with at least 10GB+ disk for /var/lib/dirsrv</li> <li>DNS domain delegation (if a DNS appliance or server already exists)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"el/freeipa/#tutorial-preface-notes-and-recommendations","title":"Tutorial Preface, Notes, and Recommendations","text":"<p>Potential Pitfalls!</p> <ul> <li>Leave SELinux enabled at all times. You will not run into SELinux   issues</li> <li>FreeIPA runs better when it controls the DNS domain that it is   given - It is recommended DNS is delegated or that FreeIPA run DNS   entirely</li> <li>FreeIPA does not run DHCP. ISC DHCP can be configured to do dynamic   DNS updates to FreeIPA or hosts can be configured to perform dynamic   DNS updates</li> </ul> <p>Recommended Information</p> <ul> <li>Keep selinux set to enforcing</li> <li> <p>DNS - You must be careful when using DNS. Here are   recommendations.<sup>1</sup></p> <ul> <li>Recommendation 1: FreeIPA runs your entire DNS for your   network - This requires the DHCP servers to set the DNS servers   to the IPA servers. This will be useful in the case that your   clients will have their SSH keys added as SSHFP records to DNS   when enrolled as clients. This also gives you the added benefit   of a client updating its own DNS entries (A and PTR records) if   the client is DHCP enabled and the IP changes if you so choose.</li> <li>Recommendation 2: FreeIPA is delegated a subdomain of a domain   used already in the network - It's not required for hosts to   live in the subdomain to be a member of the IPA domain, but you   will lose out on kerberos SSO. Do not try to hijack a domain.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Consider setting up a trust with Active Directory if you are in a   mixed environment, eg Active Directory already exists.</p> </li> <li>IPA servers should have static assigned addresses - Configured via   nmcli or directly in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*</li> <li>Try to avoid running FreeIPA without DNS - while possible, you are   creating higher maintenance</li> </ul> <p>Trust Information</p> <p>If you are in a mixed environment (both Windows and Linux/UNIX), it may prove useful to setup a trust between FreeIPA and Active Directory. If this is the case, they will need to be in different domains (e.g.,  example.com and ipa.example.com, or example.com and example.net).</p> <p>If you are in a larger environment, it may be detrimental instead. In this case, having a way to keep users in sync between AD and IPA might be the better option. This is because AD lookups can be resource intensive, and a large AD environment can slow down performance or not work at all without sssd tuning.</p> <p>All trust information is in this section</p>"},{"location":"el/freeipa/#dns","title":"DNS","text":"<p>As noted in the previous section, you must try not to hijack a domain. You can migrate records over to FreeIPA's DNS if you'd like, but care must be taken with that approach.</p> <p>While FreeIPA can do the typical DNS server work such as forward/reverse zones and various types of records, it should not be considered a full solution. It does not support views (eg, you can't have internal and external views). In the event you need to have views, that's when you need a different DNS server or service to provide this to you.</p> <p>There are two ways you can have DNS entries updated dynamically for clients, <code>--enable-dns-updates</code> for ipa-client-install and DHCP dynamic DNS updates. Both are sufficient. The latter requires additional work and is outside the scope of this document.</p>"},{"location":"el/freeipa/#external-dns-server","title":"External DNS Server","text":"<p>It is possible to run FreeIPA without a DNS server and have all records handled from an external source.

This is because it might be a real world example for some environments. It is also a result of doing a lab work to maintain this document. Regardless of what it is, it may be realistic that some environments have AD or a separate DNS appliance already in place.</p> <p>With delegation, it is not required for clients to have records in the IPA DNS domain. They can be in other domains, as long as they have all required record types (e.g., A/AAAA/PTR), with the caveat that SSO via kerberos will fail.</p> <p>When setting up delegation, refer to the documentation for your appliance or software.

Note that on a later SRU, you may need to setup an ID view (without overrides) for groups and sudo to work again.</p> <p>Below is for the service account like in the previous section, here as a reference.</p> <pre><code>dn: uid=solaris,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=ipa,dc=example,dc=com\nobjectclass: account\nobjectclass: simplesecurityobject\nuid: solaris\nuserPassword: secret123\npasswordExpirationTime: 20380119031407Z\nnsIdleTimeout: 0\n</code></pre> <pre><code>% ldapadd -xWD 'cn=Directory Manager' -f /tmp/solaris.ldif\n</code></pre> <p>Now, set the nisdomain.</p> <pre><code>% defaultdomain ipa.example.com\n% echo 'ipa.example.com' &gt; /etc/defaultdomain\n</code></pre> <p>Configure kerberos.</p> <pre><code>% vi /etc/krb5/krb5.conf\n[libdefaults]\ndefault_realm = IPA.EXAMPLE.COM\ndns_lookup_kdc = true\nverify_ap_req_nofail = false\n\n[realms]\nIPA.EXAMPLE.COM = {\n}\n\n[domain_realm]\nipa.example.com = IPA.EXAMPLE.COM\n.ipa.example.com = IPA.EXAMPLE.COM\n\n[logging]\ndefault = FILE:/var/krb5/kdc.log\nkdc = FILE:/var/krb5/kdc.log\nkdc_rotate = {\n period = 1d\n version = 10\n}\n\n[appdefaults]\nkinit = {\nrenewable = true\nforwardable= true\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Generate a keytab and bring it over.</p> <pre><code># on the ipa server\n% ipa host-add solaris11.example.com\n% ipa-getkeytab -s server1.ipa.example.com -p host/solaris11.example.com -k /tmp/solaris11.keytab\n\n# Transfer the keytab\n% scp /tmp/solaris11.keytab solaris11.example.com:/tmp\n\n# On the solaris 11 machine\n% cp /tmp/solaris11.keytab /etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\n% chmod 600 /etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\n% chmod 644 /etc/krb5/krb5.conf\n% chown root:sys /etc/krb5/*\n\n# Check the keytab\n% klist -ket /etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\n\n# Test that you can kinit\n% kinit flast2@IPA.EXAMPLE.COM\n</code></pre> <p>Create the LDAP configurations, bring the certificate, and create an NSS database.</p> <p>Solaris 11.3 vs 11.4</p> <p>Previously we had 11.3 and 11.4 configurations.

RFC 8314 entitled Cleartext Considered Obsolete: Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for Email Submission and Access recommends that you use port 465 with implicit TLS instead of STARTTLS on port 587:</p> <p>In brief, this memo now recommends that:</p> <ul> <li>TLS version 1.2 or greater be used for all traffic between MUAs and     Mail Submission Servers, and also between MUAs and Mail Access     Servers.</li> <li>MUAs and Mail Service Providers (MSPs) (a) discourage the use of     cleartext protocols for mail access and mail submission and     (b) deprecate the use of cleartext protocols for these purposes as     soon as practicable.</li> <li>Connections to Mail Submission Servers and Mail Access Servers be     made using \"Implicit TLS\" (as defined below), in preference to     connecting to the \"cleartext\" port and negotiating TLS using the     STARTTLS command or a similar command.</li> </ul> <p>More specifically:</p> <p>The STARTTLS mechanism on port 587 is relatively widely deployed due to the situation with port 465 (discussed in Section 7.3). This differs from IMAP and POP services where Implicit TLS is more widely deployed on servers than STARTTLS. It is desirable to migrate core protocols used by MUA software to Implicit TLS over time, for consistency as well as for the additional reasons discussed in Appendix A.</p> <p>However, some have conflated SMTPS with implicit TLS on port 465, which is not the same thing. In particular, section 7.3 of RFC 8314 explains that SMTPS was briefly assigned to port 465 and subsequently revoked:</p> <p>... Unfortunately, some widely deployed mail software interpreted \"smtps\" as \"submissions\" [RFC6409] and used that port for email submission by default when an end user requested security during account setup.</p> <p>... Although STARTTLS on port 587 has been deployed, it has not replaced the deployed use of Implicit TLS submission on port 465.</p> <p>To reiterate, \"Implicit TLS submission\" which is defined in section 3 is not the same as SMTPS and you should use port 465 over port 587 if possible. Another point of confusion is the use of SSL on port 465. As a result, you\\'ll find many resources on the Internet claiming not to use port 465. It is true that you should prefer TLS over SSL, but port 465 is not deprecated.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The RFC also states:</p> <p>Note that there is no significant difference between the security properties of STARTTLS on port 587 and Implicit TLS on port 465 if the implementations are correct and if both the client and the server are configured to require successful negotiation of TLS prior to Message Submission.</p> <p>The key phrase here being \"require successful negotation\". If STARTTLS is not configured this way, then it is less secure than Implicit TLS.</p>"},{"location":"training/ex362/","title":"EX362 Exam Prep","text":"<p>This page contains the necessary resources to help you prepare for the Red Hat Certified Specialist in Identity Management exam, EX362.
