Linux Guide and Hints
=====================

The source code for this page can be found on `Github
<https://github.com/nazunalika/linux-guide-and-hints>`_. This page contains
tutorials and generally useful information regarding packages and system
administration in |Fedora|, |Rocky| and |CentOS|.

.. warning::

    Due to the number of articles out there about disabling SELinux, we felt
    this notice is important. Disabling SELinux is a terrible idea. See our
    `antipatterns
    <https://linuxguideandhints.com/security/antipatterns.html#disabling-selinux>`_
    page as well as the `Rocky Linux documentation
    <https://docs.rockylinux.org/es/guides/security/learning_selinux/>`_.
