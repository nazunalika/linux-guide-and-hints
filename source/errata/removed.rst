Errata
^^^^^^

Wondering what happened to a removed article or information? This section will
explain what went missing and why.

Removed articles
----------------

07-26-2022

- negativo was renamed to nvidia.

07-24-2022

- Wayland article contains outdated information, so removed.

02-13-2022

- Removed outdated information from fedora/emulators, slated to be rewritten.

11-04-2021

- Removed gitlab page because GitLab sucks.

07-08-2021

- Removed gettingstarted because it contains outdated information.

06-28-2021

- Removed fedora/virtualbox and fedora/vmware. We recommend using KVM and
  virt-manager instead. Also, I don't use either so I wouldn't be able to keep
  the articles up to date anyway.

06-06-2021

- Removed fedora/pulseaudio because Pipewire is now used by default.
- Removed fedora/bup article because it contains outdated information. The
  README for the project is outdated, so I have no motivation to provide info
  for it currently. I may revisit this later.

05-18-2021

- The centos pages were renamed to el to be more general and include Rocky
  Linux information.

12-17-2020

- training/ex294 was removed, as it was not a fit for this website and was
  missing credit to the original author nor could it be modified in a manner to
  suit us. people who are training for the ex294 are encouraged to look for the
  EX407 article on `lisenet <https://www.lisenet.com/2019/ansible-sample-exam-for-ex407/>`__
  as it will be sufficient enough to train for the exam. I personally highly
  recommend using this as a resource instead.

12-01-2019

- misc/security was renamed to security/antipatterns.

11-17-2019

- Removed Blockify article because it is no longer maintained. Spotify prohibits
  ad blockers.

- Removed gentoo/gdm article because the bug is now fixed.

Removed information
-------------------

07-17-2021

- Removed information on running Proton manually as it is not supported and
  doesn't seem to work reliably with the latest version of Proton-GE.

02-24-2021

- Remove ESNI info which seems to be broken/vaporware at the moment.

02-02-2021

- Remove manual Wine installation tips for New Vegas and outdated modding
  instructions. Prefer Proton and the Viva New Vegas installation guide.

12-06-2019

- Remove PCSX2 instructions since the RPMFusion package no longer exists. You
  should install it via Flatpak instead.

11-29-2019

- Removed Git workflow section

11-17-2019

- Removed COPR links that no longer exist.
