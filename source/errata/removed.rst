Errata
^^^^^^

Wondering what happened to a removed article or information? This section will
explain what went missing and why.

Removed articles
----------------

06-06-2021

- Removed fedora/pulseaudio because Pipewire is now used by default.

05-18-2021

- The centos pages were renamed to el to be more general and include Rocky
  Linux information.

12-17-2020

- training/ex294 was removed, as it was not a fit for this website and was
  missing credit to the original author nor could it be modified in a manner to
  suit us. people who are training for the ex294 are encouraged to look for the
  EX407 article on `lisenet <https://www.lisenet.com/2019/ansible-sample-exam-for-ex407/>`__
  as it will be sufficient enough to train for the exam. I personally highly
  recommend using this as a resource instead.

12-01-2019

- misc/security was renamed to security/antipatterns.

11-17-2019

- Removed Blockify article because it is no longer maintained. Spotify prohibits
  ad blockers.

- Removed gentoo/gdm article because the bug is now fixed.

Removed information
-------------------

02-24-2021

- Remove ESNI info which seems to be broken/vaporware at the moment.

02-02-2021

- Remove manual Wine installation tips for New Vegas and outdated modding
  instructions. Prefer Proton and the Viva New Vegas installation guide.

12-06-2019

  should install it via Flatpak instead.

11-29-2019
