Auto-Provisioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This page goes over various ways that installs can be automated without the use of PXE. Instead, we can use templated scripts with pre-configured commands, boot images, and mirrors for builds. We cover the following here:

* CentOS 7, 8
* Enterprise Linux 8+
* Fedora
* openSUSE 15+
* Windows Server
