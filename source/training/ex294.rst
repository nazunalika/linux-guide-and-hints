Overview
--------

The Red Hat Certified Engineer exam for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 tests your knowledge of the RHCSA plus using Ansible for automation. To pass the same, you must understand the RHCSA concepts as well as be able to configure and utilize ansible.

Exam Information
----------------

The EX294 exam tests your knowledge in a real world format style test - Meaning just like any Red Hat exam, it is performance-based and you perform tasks as if you were on the job. You are evaluated on the tasks you perform and if they meet the objective criteria. The EX294 supersedes the EX300 exam which was for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

**To take the exam, you must have at least an RHCSA. To become an RHCE, you must have an RHCSA. An RHCE is required to become and RHCA.**

  * ansible4 is a member of db host group

* Run a test ping to all ansible nodes using the setup module

.. admonition:: Solution
   :class: toggle

   # cat ~/adhoc
   #!/bin/bash
   # Copy the keys using ansible adhoc
   ansible all --ask-pass -m authorized_key -a 'user=ansible state=present key="{{lookup('file', '/home/automation/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'}}"'

Task 2 - File Content
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: What objectives does this test?

   * Understand core components of Ansible: Inventories, Modules, Plays, Playbooks
   * Create Ansible plays and playbooks: Know how to work with commonly used Ansible modules
   * Create Ansible plays and playbooks: Create playbooks to configure systems to a specific state
   * Use Ansible modules for system administration tasks that work with: File content

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/motd.yml` that does the following:

* Replace `/etc/motd` with text that depends on the host group:

  * web: "Welcome to an Apache server"
  * db: "Welcome to a MariaDB server"
  * proxy: "Welcome to an HAProxy server"

.. admonition:: Solution
   :class: toggle

   You should use the "copy" module that fills in the content for you and use the "when" conditional.

Task 3 - Configure SSH Server
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: What objectives does this test?

   * Understand core components of Ansible: Modules, Plays, Playbooks
   * Create Ansible plays and playbooks: Know how to work with commonly used Ansible modules
   * Create Ansible plays and playbooks: Create playbooks to configure systems to a specific state
   * Use Ansible modules for system administration tasks that work with: Services, File content

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/sshd.yml` that runs on all hosts and configures ssh like:

* Banner is set to `/etc/motd`
* X11Forwarding is disabled
* MaxAuthTries is set to 3
* PermitRootLogin is set to no
* sshd is enabled

.. admonition:: Solution
   :class: toggle

   You should copy the configuration file with your necessary changes. You can also use regex, but that may or may not be clean.

Task 4 - Ansible Vault
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: What objectives does this test?

   * Use advanced Ansible features: Use Ansible Vault in playbooks to protect sensitive data

Create an ansible vault file at `~/automation/plays/secrets.yml` with a password of **redhat** with the following variables:

* user_password: redhat
* database_password: redhat

.. code:: shell
   :class: toggle

   # ansible-vault encrypt_string --ask-vault-pass 'redhat' --name 'user_password'
   # ansible-vault encrypt_string --ask-vault-pass 'redhat' --name 'database_password'

Task 5 - Users and Groups
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: What objectives does this test?

   * Understand core components of Ansible: Inventories, Modules, Variables, Plays, Playbooks
   * Use Ansible modules for system administration tasks that work with: Users and groups

Create a variables file at `~/automation/vars/userlist.yml` that lists the following:

.. code:: shell

   ---
   users:
     - username: bob
       uid: 2100
     - username: bill
       uid: 2101
     - username: mary
       uid: 2201
     - username: vincent
       uid: 2202

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/users.yml` that uses the vault file `~/automation/plays/secrets.yml` to:

* Users whose user ID starts with *21* should be created only on the web host group
* Users whose user ID starts with *22* should be created only on the db host group
* All users should be in the *wheel* group
* All users passwords should be used from the vault (user_password)
* Shell should be `/bin/bash`
* Passwords should be SHA512
* Each user should have an SSH key (you can use the ansible keys or create their own)

.. admonition:: Solution
   :class: toggle

   You can solve this in two different ways. One way is to create two separate blocks where each work against their respective host group if you plan on using the same keys from the ansible user. Another way is to have a singular task that creates the users and their keys on their respective servers. Regardless, you will use the "when" conditional.

Task 6 - Schedulded Tasks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/cronjobs.yml` that runs on the proxy host group and does:

* Cronjob created for the root user that runs every hour
* Cronjob appends /var/log/time.log with the output of the `date` command

Task 7 - Create Roles - Database
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a role called example-mysql and store it in `~/automation/roles`. The role should perform the following:

* A primary partition number 1 of size 700MB on device `/dev/sdb` or `/dev/vdb` is created.
* The LVM volume group called vg_db is created that uses the primary partition
* lv_mysql is created of size 512MB in the volume group vg_db
* lv_mysql should be XFS formatted
* lv_mysql is permanently mounted on /mnt/mysql for backups.
* firewalld is configured to allow all incoming traffic on port TCP 3306
* mysql-server should be installed
* mysql root user password should be set from the variable database_password in `~/automation/plays/secrets.yml`
* mysql server should be started and enabled on boot
* mysql server configuration file is generated from the my.cnf.j2 Jinja2 template (template is below)

.. code:: shell

   # cat ~/automation/plays/templates/my.cnf.j2
   [mysqld]
   bind_address = REPLACE_ME_IPV4VAR_OR_FACT
   skip_name_resolve
   datadir=/var/lib/mysql
   socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

   symbolic-links=0
   sql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES 

   [mysqld_safe]
   log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log
   pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid

Create the playbook `~/automation/plays/mysql.yml` that ruses that role and runs on the db host group.

.. note:: Solution
   :class: toggle

   You will use the ansible_default_ipv4.address variable to solve the template.

Task 8 - Use Archiving to backup mysql
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/archive.yml` that runs on all db hosts:

* Create `/mnt/mysql/database_list.txt` that has the line: dev,test,qa,prod
* Create a gzip of the file and started at `/mnt/mysql/archive.gz`

Task 9 - Create Roles - Web
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a role called example-apache and store it in `~/automation/roles`. The role should perform the following:

* Install the packages httpd, mod_ssl, and php
* firewalld is configured to allow traffic on port 80 and 443
* The `httpd` service should be restarted each time */var/www/html/index.html* has been updated
* Create a `index.html.j2` template that creates the index file.

.. code:: shell

   # cat index.html.j2
   The address of this server is: REPLACE_ME_IPV4VAR_OR_FACT

Create a playbook `~/automation/plays/apache.yml` that uses that role only on the web host group.

.. note:: Solution
   :class: toggle

   You will use the ansible_default_ipv4.address variable to solve the template.

Task 10 - Download Roles from Galaxy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use Ansible Galaxy to download and install the `geerlingguy.haproxy` role into `~/automation/roles`.

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/haproxy.yml` that runs the haproxy role on the proxy host group. It must be the following:

* Load balance requests between the hosts in web
* Use roundrobin
* Backend servers should be using port 80 only
* firewalld allows port 80 traffic

To test the playbook on completion, run `curl http://ansible4.example.com`, which should output the IP address of one of the web servers. Run it again to check load balancing.

Task 11 - Security
++++++++++++++++++

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/selinux.yml` and does the following:

* Uses the selinux RHEL system role
* Enables httpd_can_network_connect boolean on the web group

++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/facts.yml` that runs on hosts in the db group:

* A custom Ansible fact **server_role=mysql** is created and can be retrieved from ansible_local.custom.sample_exam using the setup module.

Task 14 - Install Packages
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/packages.yml` that installs packages like so:

* On proxy hosts: tcpdump, mailx
* On db hosts: lsof, mailx

Task 15 - Managing Services
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a playbook at `~/automation/plays/target.yml` that runs on the web group:

* Set default boot target to multi-user

Task 16 - Template Management
