       :description: Materials to prepare for the Red Hat Certified Specialist in Security: Linux exam.

This page contains the necessary resources to help you prepare for the Red Hat Certified Specialist in Security exam, EX415. This follows loosely the youtube playlist as much as possible with various examples and ideas.

The list of objectives can be found `here <https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex415-red-hat-certified-specialist-security-linux-exam>`__. Note that the exam objectives can change at any time. It is the responsibility of the reader to always review the objectives prior to studying and taking the exam to ensure success.

.. note::

Overview
--------

The video series goes over setting up your VM's to study for the exam as well as going over the objectives, following the objectives as outlined by Red Hat. The list of objectives can be found `here <https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex415-red-hat-certified-specialist-security-linux-exam>`__.

Exam Information
----------------

The EX415 exam tests your knowledge in a real world format style test - Meaning just like any Red Hat exam, it is performance-based and you perform tasks as if you were on the job. You are evaluated on the tasks you perform and if they meet the objective criteria. The EX415 is related to various security components in the Red Hat ecosystem and counts toward the RHCA (Red Hat Certified Architect).

**To take the exam, you must have at least an RHCSA. If you are attempting to become a Red Hat Certified Architect, you must have an RHCE.**

Resources
---------

The resources will be listed in their various sections where needed.

Use Red Hat Ansible Engine
--------------------------

Install Red Hat Ansible Engine on a control node

.. code:: shell

   # If studying on CentOS, you will need EPEL.
   % yum install epel-release -y

   # Install ansible
   % yum install ansible -y

Configure managed nodes

.. code:: shell

   # On all nodes, create the ansible user with full SUDO permissions
   % useradd ansible

   % visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/ansible
   ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

   # Create a temporary password on all nodes to pass out the keys without
   # performing a copy and paste
   % passwd ansible

   # On the control node, generate SSH keys
   % su - ansible
   ansible% ssh-keygen
   enerating public/private rsa key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa): 
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
   Enter same passphrase again: 
   Your identification has been saved in /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa.
   Your public key has been saved in /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
   The key fingerprint is:
   SHA256:. . . ansible@control.example.com
   The key's randomart image is:
   +---[RSA 2048]----+
   . . .
   +----[SHA256]-----+

   # Pass the keys to all systems
   ansible% ssh-copy-id control.example.com
   ansible% ssh-copy-id node1.example.com
   ansible% ssh-copy-id node2.example.com
   ansible% exit

   # On all systems, lock the ansible user
   % passwd -l ansible

Configure a simple inventory

.. code:: shell
   
   % vi /etc/ansible/inventory
   control ansible_host=192.168.10.10
   node1 ansible_host=192.168.10.11
   node2 ansible_host=192.168.10.12

   [control]
   control ansible_host=192.168.10.10

   [nodes]
   node1 ansible_host=192.168.10.11
   node2 ansible_host=192.168.10.12

Perform basic management of systems

.. code:: shell

   # Example running a command
   % ansible all -a 'uptime'

   # Example running a module
   % ansible all -m yum -a 'name=* state=latest'

Run a provided playbook against specified nodes

.. code:: shell

   # Generic example
   % ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/playbook.yaml

   # If it has variables you can change
   % ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/playbook.yaml --extra-vars="host=node1"

Configure Intrusion Detection
-----------------------------

Intrusion detection is a way of identifying the suspicious or malicious network, file system, or policy violations. In the case of a simple file system monitoring, we will use AIDE.

.. code:: shell

   % yum install aide -y

   # This will create the initial baseline for the system
   % aide --init
   % mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz

   # You can then run a check to see if anything has changed. (There won't be any)
   % aide --check

   # Let's add some directories to monitor
   % mkdir /opt/static
   % vi /etc/aide.conf
   /opt/static DIR

   % aide --update
   % mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz
   % cd /opt/static
   % touch example
   % chown operator:root .

   # When you run the check, there should be a change
   % aide --check

   # Configure a cron job to check once a night
   % crontab -e
   0 0 * * * /usr/sbin/aide --check

When configuring AIDE, there are many options. In fact, a lot of them are commented throughout the file.

So for example, you can use ! to negate checking a particular directory. For example !/var/log/httpd/ would prevent checking the httpd log directory as it would always be changing. Here are some other various examples.

.. code:: shell
   
   # Do not monitor any logs or spool
   !/var/log/.*
   !/var/spool/.*

   # Log only access to a directory or file
   APP_ACCESS = a
   /opt/static APP_ACCESS

Configure Encrypted Storage
---------------------------

When you install a CentOS 7, CentOS 8, or even Fedora, an option is given to the user if they want to encrypt their disk. Typically, the /home directory is encrypted in this scenario. The /home directory, upon being mounted at boot, requests a password to be entered. This is LUKS in action.

The LUKS binaries and support should be available usually by default. But, in the package isn't available, you can install cryptsetup. That will provide the minimal required to setup a luks encrypted file system.

To setup a basic encrypted partition, let's do it on node1:

.. code:: shell

   % cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1
   
   # You can then verify the headers.
   % cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdb1
   LUKS header information for /dev/sdb1

   Version:        1
   Cipher name:    aes
   Cipher mode:    xts-plain64
   Hash spec:      sha256
   Payload offset: 4096
   MK bits:        512
   MK digest:      10 dc 1c c8 5c 4f c5 30 30 58 f8 90 3d ed 61 97 dc 0b d6 4b 
   MK salt:        e3 61 e8 c9 6b 59 a3 29 55 6c c5 4c dd 63 2f 66 
                   fd e4 a1 72 29 48 57 a4 0b e7 f2 c9 dd 12 0f bc 
   MK iterations:  119809
   UUID:           b2a181b0-4078-415e-94c2-18c51a886a3b

           Iterations:             1855886
           Salt:                   c1 6f fe 4e 66 ce 90 e5 68 19 ca fb 29 35 b1 a0 
                                   0f d1 66 0a dc 0a cc 6e 69 4e 6c 07 d0 51 6d b8 
           Key material offset:    8
           AF stripes:             4000
   Key Slot 1: DISABLED
   Key Slot 2: DISABLED
   Key Slot 3: DISABLED
   Key Slot 4: DISABLED
   Key Slot 5: DISABLED
   Key Slot 6: DISABLED
   Key Slot 7: DISABLED

   % cryptsetup isLuks -v /dev/sdb1
   Command successful.

   # Open the partition and create a file system
   % cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 mnt
   % mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/mnt
   % mount /dev/mapper/mnt /mnt
   % touch /mnt/test
   % umount /mnt
   % cryptsetup luksClose mnt

   # If you want it to mount at boot time before setting up tang/clevis
   % vi /etc/crypttab
   mnt /dev/sdb1 none none

   % vi /etc/fstab
   . . .
   /dev/mapper/mnt /mnt xfs defaults 1 2

When you reboot, it should ask for a passphrase. The passphrase you entered during the setup should work.

Let's setup NBDE, which is Network-Bound Disk Encryption. NBDE is essentially a way to allow the user to encrypt volumes of disks, whether physical or virtual, without requiring manual intervention to enter a password at boot time. There are a few components of NBDE:

* Tang: The server for binding data to network presence. In essence, it provides available data for when a system is bound to a secure network. It is stateless and does not store keys, nor identifiable information of a client.
* Clevis: A pluggable framework for automating decryption. Clevis unlocks LUKS volumes and acts as a client.

  * Pin: A plugin to the clevis framework. This pin is used to interact with the tang NBDE server.

Clevis and Tang are both the client and server components for NBDE. More information can be found `here <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Security_Guide/sec-Using_Network-Bound_Disk_Encryption.html>`__. 

Setup tang on the control node.

.. code:: shell

   % yum install tang -y

   # Enable tang. Notice it's a socket unit, not a service. It is because
   # tang is stateless.
   % systemctl enable tangd.socket --now

   # Open the http port
   % firewall-cmd --add-service=http
   % firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent

Remember the luks volume we created on one of the nodes? Let's set it up with NBDE.

.. code:: shell

   % yum install clevis clevis-dracut clevis-luks clevis-systemd -y
   % CFG='{"url":"http://192.168.10.10"}'
   % clevis bind luks -d /dev/sdb1 tang "$CFG"
   . . .
   Do you wish to trust these keys? [ynYN] Y
   Do you wish to initialize /dev/sdb1? [yn] y
   Enter existing LUKS password:

   % luksmeta show -d /dev/sdb1
   0   active empty
   1   active STRING
   2 inactive empty
   3 inactive empty
   4 inactive empty
   5 inactive empty
   6 inactive empty
   7 inactive empty

   # Modify /etc/fstab and /etc/cryptab like so...
   % vi /etc/crypttab
   mnt /dev/sdb1 none _netdev

   % vi /etc/fstab
   . . .
   /dev/mapper/mnt /mnt xfs defaults,_netdev 1 2

   % dracut -f
   % systemctl enable clevis-luks-askpass.path

   # Reboot the system and test.
   % init 6

There may be a case where you want high availability with your tang servers. If this is the case and you have two tang servers up and running, you would configure your nodes to use both servers.

.. code:: shell

   % CFG='{"t":2,"pins":{"tang":[{"url":"http://192.168.10.10"},{"url":"192.168.10.20"}]}}'
   % clevis luks bind -d /dev/sdb1 sss "$CFG"

Rotating keys is fairly simple.

.. code:: shell

   % DB=/var/db/tang
   % jose jwk gen -i '{"alg":"ES512"}' -o $DB/new_sig.jwk
   % jose jwk gen -i '{"alg":"ECMR"}' -o $DB/new_exc.jwk
   % mv $DB/old_sig.jwk $DB/.old_sig.jwk
   % mv $DB/old_exc.jwk $DB/.old_exc.jwk

The old clients will still continue to use the old keys. The old keys can be removed once the clients are using the new keys. *Removing the old keys before this can easily result in data loss.*

Optionally, you can configure clevis to unlock removable media that has been encrypted with luks. The following procedure allows removable disks to be automatically unlocked when plugged in, in the case of being the GNOME environment. Otherwise, `clevis luks unlock` works just as well.

.. code:: shell

   % yum install clevis-udisks2 -y
   % init 6
   % CFG='{"url":"http://192.168.10.10"}'
   % clevis bind luks -d /dev/sdc1 tang "$CFG"

Restrict USB Devices
--------------------

USB Guard is a software that can allow or block specific USB devices. This is done to prevent malicious devices from being plugged into a system or even whitelist very specific devices (such as a yubikey, but not another USB device that acts as a keyboard).

.. code:: shell

   % yum install usbguard -y

   # Generate a base policy of what's currently plugged in
   % usbguard generate-policy > /etc/usbguard/rules.conf

The policy that is generated from above would look something like this.

.. code:: shell

   % cat /etc/usbguard/rules.conf
   allow id 1d6b:0002 serial "0000:00:14.0" name "xHCI Host Controller" hash "jEP/6WzviqdJ5VSeTUY8PatCNBKeaREvo2OqdplND/o=" parent-hash "G1ehGQdrl3dJ9HvW9w2HdC//pk87pKzFE1WY25bq8k4=" with-interface 09:00:00
   allow id 1d6b:0003 serial "0000:00:14.0" name "xHCI Host Controller" hash "3Wo3XWDgen1hD5xM3PSNl3P98kLp1RUTgGQ5HSxtf8k=" parent-hash "G1ehGQdrl3dJ9HvW9w2HdC//pk87pKzFE1WY25bq8k4=" with-interface 09:00:00
   allow id 0853:0111 serial "" name "Realforce 87" hash "tFZkrWQsnTe7xB6rnXvrskg3d1fbZ8azPVGpQoMsiNo=" parent-hash "jEP/6WzviqdJ5VSeTUY8PatCNBKeaREvo2OqdplND/o=" via-port "1-1" with-interface 03:01:01
   allow id 046d:c52b serial "" name "USB Receiver" hash "5zeNOFQHsaZg43M4KgvCUwvU8C+GNCY8Rgdlwxc+Vpk=" parent-hash "jEP/6WzviqdJ5VSeTUY8PatCNBKeaREvo2OqdplND/o=" via-port "1-2" with-interface { 03:01:01 03:01:02 03:00:00 }
   allow id 8087:0a2b serial "" name "" hash "TtRMrWxJil9GOY/JzidUEOz0yUiwwzbLm8D7DJvGxdg=" parent-hash "jEP/6WzviqdJ5VSeTUY8PatCNBKeaREvo2OqdplND/o=" via-port "1-7" with-interface { e0:01:01 e0:01:01 e0:01:01 e0:01:01 e0:01:01 e0:01:01 e0:01:01 }
   allow id 5986:2113 serial "" name "Integrated Camera" hash "8WIUHlRXRajhb9Tp+q4NUjsyob4CQFAPUUTwCr+amic=" parent-hash "jEP/6WzviqdJ5VSeTUY8PatCNBKeaREvo2OqdplND/o=" via-port "1-8" with-interface { 0e:01:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 0e:02:00 }
   allow id 0bda:0316 serial "20120501030900000" name "USB3.0-CRW" hash "WG1MSC3YZsmCslTNGpjTTjT2lUvhNfU4gEVvD3gIuV4=" parent-hash "3Wo3XWDgen1hD5xM3PSNl3P98kLp1RUTgGQ5HSxtf8k=" with-interface 08:06:50

So now, if we enable and start usbguard, any new usb devices plugged in will be denied.

.. code:: shell

   % systemctl enable usbguard --now
   
   # At this point, I've plugged in my yubikey.
   % usbguard list-devices | grep block
   15: block id 1d6b:0002 serial "0000:3c:00.0" name "xHCI Host Controller" hash "+k9gUUE6Cnbob2WB/I//KMZ1hZ1UgvI6RrqNkIDvdmQ=" parent-hash "iu6QpiQUdPs2m89ViiXPDZXOJ69o6tB9kpJnYaWdvME=" via-port "usb3" with-interface 09:00:00
   16: block id 1d6b:0003 serial "0000:3c:00.0" name "xHCI Host Controller" hash "f/j0P3jeotLSPQLacl0JEBDT/k4mgTo84SKV39leYSc=" parent-hash "iu6QpiQUdPs2m89ViiXPDZXOJ69o6tB9kpJnYaWdvME=" via-port "usb4" with-interface 09:00:00

   # Let's allow the devices
   % usbguard allow-device --permanent 15
   % usbguard allow-device --permanent 16
   % usbguard list-devices | grep block
   18: block id 1050:0407 serial "" name "YubiKey OTP+FIDO+CCID" hash "UP/fS/jaI4Elg4Fej+gf1QXLWPleJ54MqMtO16eSmr8=" parent-hash "+k9gUUE6Cnbob2WB/I//KMZ1hZ1UgvI6RrqNkIDvdmQ=" via-port "3-1" with-interface { 03:01:01 03:00:00 0b:00:00 }

   # In my case, it was my controller that was blocked initially. Now that it's unblocked, the device is blocked.
   % usbguard allow-device --permanent 18

   # If I wanted to block a device even after allowing it
   % usbguard block-device 15
   % usbguard block-device 16

In the event I want to allow another user/group to allow or block devices, you can allow it in the poolicy.

.. code:: shell

   # This allows anyone in the staff group to be able to modify USB device authorization states,
   # list USB devices, listen to exception events, and list USB authorization policies.
   % usbguard add-user -g staff --devices=modify,list,listen --policy=list --exceptions=listen

It is also possible to be dynamic with the rules configuration, using the rule language to create your own rules. So for example. I only want to allow my keyboard access to port 1-1.

.. code:: shell

   % vi /tmp/rules.conf
   allow id 0853:0111 serial "" name "Realforce 87" hash "tFZkrWQsnTe7xB6rnXvrskg3d1fbZ8azPVGpQoMsiNo=" parent-hash "jEP/6WzviqdJ5VSeTUY8PatCNBKeaREvo2OqdplND/o=" via-port "1-1" with-interface 03:01:01
   reject via-port "1-1"

   # Now we install it. It is also possible to just modify the file directly, but that
   # is generally not recommended.
   % install -m 0600 -o root -g root /tmp/rules.conf /etc/usbguard/rules.conf

Manage System Login Security using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

PAM has been an essential part of Linux (and Unix, where it started) for years. PAM first appeared in the Linux world on Red Hat Linux 3.0.4 in 1996. PAM serves as a way to provide dynamic authentication support for services on a Linux system as well as applications. There are four types of management groups in PAM:

* Auth: Validates/verifies a user's identity. It does this in multiple ways. The most common way is requesting and checking a password.
* Account: The account modules check that an account is a valid target under the current conditions, such as expiration, time of day, or even access to the requested service.
* Password: These modules are responsible for updating passwords. They are generally used tightly with the auth modules. These modules can also be used to enforce strong passwords.
* Session: These modules are responsible for the service environment. They define actions that are performed at the beginning and at the end of a session. A session starts when the user has successfully logged into the system.

To configure password policies and faillock, you have two options: Manually modifying `/etc/pam.d/{system-auth,password-auth}` and `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` or using authconfig. We'll stick with `authconfig` for now and verify the pam files.

.. code:: block

   # Let's try to set some CIS benchmarks settings. Below we are:
   #  * Require at least 1 lowercase letter
   #  * Require at least 1 uppercase letter
   #  * Require at least 1 number
   #  * Require at least 1 other character
   #  * Minimum of 14 characters
   #  * Turning on faillock, locking a user after 5 failures, 15 minutes before the account is unlocked.
   % authconfig --passminlen=14 --enablereqlower --enablerequpper --enablereqdigit --enablereqother --enablefaillock --faillockargs="audit deny=5 unlock_time=900" --updateall

   # There is an odd thing that happens to the password-auth file. This is to make it consistent.
   % cp /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth

   # Verify the pwquality.conf file
   % grep -v '^#' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
   minlen = 14
   lcredit = -1
   ucredit = -1
   dcredit = -1
   ocredit = -1

   # Here's a system-auth example. As you can see, the faillock modules are surrounding the pam_unix in
   # the auth stack, but comes before pam_unix in account. This ensures the lockout is successful. The
   # pwquality module is set in the password module. The settings in /etc/security/pwquality.conf apply
   # here.
   % cat /etc/pam.d/system-auth

   #%PAM-1.0

Configure System Auditing
-------------------------

Auditd is a subsystem that deals in access monitoring and accounting for Linux. It was built and designed to be integrated deep into the kernel and watch for system calls, whether normal or malicious, as such to create an audit trail. It does not provide any additional security. Instead, it acts as a logger of violations and actions performed on the system. Because of the deep integration, auditd is used as the logger for SELinux.

There's a couple of ways to enable auditd rules. 

* You can either modify `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` or drop a file appended with `.rules` and then run augenrules
* You can run `auditctl` - Though the next time auditd or the system is restarted, the rule you have added is lost. This should only be used as a test.

What you'll find when you view the initial rules is that you'll see a `-D` (which deletes all current rules) and then a `-b`, which is a backlog buffer. As for the syntax of an audit rule where we are attempting to monitor something, it generally works like this:

.. code:: shell

   # Action can be always/never, filter can be task, exit, user
   -a action,filter \
   # field=value specifies additional options that modify the rule to match events.
   # It can match based on arch, group ID, process ID, and many others. See man auditctl(8)
   -F field=value \
   # This is an interfield comparison. It checks whether something equals or doesn't equal another value.
   # Example, -C uid!=euid means that the UID of the event should NOT equal/match the EFFECTIVE UID
   -C comparison \
   # Specify the system call by name. Examples would be setuid, execve. See /usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h
   -S system call \
   # This is a key that can be used to match against when running ausearch or aureport. This can also be
   # specified using -F key=name instead of using -k name
   -k key

   # Example ruleset:
   # Delete all rules
   -D

   # Set backlog to 8192, way above the RHEL 7 default
   -b 8192

   # Let's monitor calling su for uid's equal to or greater than 1000
   -a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/su -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged
   -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S setuid -Fa0=0 -F exe=/usr/bin/su -k privileged
   -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S setresuid -F a0=0 -F exe=/usr/bin/sudo -k privileged
   -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k privileged

   # Any time the su command is called (which is a setuid binary), it is logged under the key privileged.
   # Here's an example of me calling sudo su -
   % ausearch -k privileged -ui 1000 -x /usr/bin/su

What if though, you don't want to configure your own rules? Or come up with your own? What if you just want some form of compliance (like PCI DSS)? Well thankfully there is some predefined rules provided to you.

.. code:: shell
   
   % ls /usr/share/doc/audit-2.8.5/rules | sort
   10-base-config.rules
   10-no-audit.rules
   11-loginuid.rules
   12-cont-fail.rules
   12-ignore-error.rules
   20-dont-audit.rules
   21-no32bit.rules
   22-ignore-chrony.rules
   23-ignore-filesystems.rules
   30-nispom.rules
   30-ospp-v42.rules
   30-pci-dss-v31.rules
   30-stig.rules
   31-privileged.rules
   32-power-abuse.rules
   40-local.rules
   41-containers.rules
   42-injection.rules
   43-module-load.rules
   70-einval.rules
   71-networking.rules
   99-finalize.rules
   README-rules

You can easily take these rules and copy them, run augenrules, and you're golden. Here's an example.

.. code:: shell

   % cp /usr/share/doc/audit-2.8.5/rules/30-pci-dss-v31.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/pci.rules
   % augenrules
   # Let's grep for a part...
   % grep 'clock_settime' /etc/audit/audit.rules
   -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S clock_settime -F a0=0x0 -F key=10.4.2b-time-change
   -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S clock_settime -F a0=0x0 -F key=10.4.2b-time-change

   # Though, you could grep for just 'always,exit' and get a much bigger result.

Looks like our rules took and they're active.

For giggles, let's produce some audit reports on my system.

A nice thing to know how to configure too is the auditd settings themselves in `/etc/audit/auditd.conf`. This configuration can be modified to control how big logs can be, what to do if the filesystem is filled up, or what to do when the logs have been maxed out. See `man auditd.conf 5`.

Configure SELinux
-----------------

If you have used RHEL or CentOS (or even Fedora) and looked up guides on how to setup or configure something, you may notice that some tend to start out the same exact way: "Disable SELinux". This is an errorneous and quite frankly, a bad set of advice to ever give to a user. Disabling the security integrity of your system to install an application should always be considered to be poor advice. There is no reason or case where you must disable the security layers of your system. From a support standpoint in fact, if you are a CentOS user and go to the IRC channel on Freenode, you will be denied support for having it disabled.

"What about anti virus though? My company dictates we use $x and we have to disable it to use it." Again, you are disabling a core security component of the kernel and operating system for no gain. In fact, you could just use ClamAV and have no SELinux policy violations. But that is beyond the scope of this section.

To ensure SELinux is enforcing, you can run the `getenforce` command. If it is set to "disabled", you will need to enable it and relabel your filesystem.

.. code:: shell

   % getenforce
   Disabled
   % vi /etc/selinux/config
   #SELINUX=disabled
   SELINUX=enforcing

   % touch /.autorelabel
   % init 6

In most general use cases, there are a lot of booleans that can be set that enable or disable a specific feature. Here are some common examples using httpd (apache).

.. code:: shell

   % getsebool -a | grep httpd
   . . .
   ( lots of settings! )

   # A common one to enable is httpd_unified
   # This boolean allows apache/nginx to perform writes under httpd_sys_content_rw_t
   % setsebool httpd_unified 1

   # Another odd one is httpd_enable_homedir
   # This allows users to have a ~/public_html directory to be accessible
   % setsebool httpd_enable_homedirs 1

All files and directories have an SELinux context. They usually have, in the general case, stock/default contexts that do fine in most cases. For example. `/var/www/html` and `/srv/www` get `httpd_sys_content_t` by default.

.. code:: shell

   % matchpathcon /srv/www
   /srv/www        system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0
   % matchpathcon /var/www/html
   /var/www/html   system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0

You can find all the contexts using the `semanage` command. You'll be surprised at the number of contexts there are.

.. code:: shell

   % semanage fcontext -l

Let's say you want to make some directory outside of the norm allowable by SELinux for httpd.

.. code:: shell

   % mkdir /opt/www
   % semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/opt/www(/.*)?"
   % restorecon -Rv /opt/www

   # There is also the chcon command, but it is not permanent. A restorecon or
   # an autorelabel will wipe out the contexts.

You will find if you run `cp` the contexts will change based on the directory the file lands. If you run `mv`, the context moves with it. If you find if a context is set incorrectly, `restorecon` will come to the rescue.

.. code:: shell

   % ls -lZ /tmp/id_rsa*
   -rw-------. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 1843 Nov 19 22:27 /tmp/id_rsa
   -rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0  415 Nov 19 22:27 /tmp/id_rsa.pub
   % mv /tmp/id_rsa* ~/.ssh/
   % ls -lZ ~/.ssh/
   total 12
   -rw-------. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 1843 Nov 19 22:27 id_rsa
   -rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0  415 Nov 19 22:27 id_rsa.pub
   % restorecon -v ~/.ssh/*
   Relabeled /root/.ssh/id_rsa from unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 to unconfined_u:object_r:ssh_home_t:s0
   Relabeled /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub from unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 to unconfined_u:object_r:ssh_home_t:s0

   # Not the best example, but you get the idea.

Some interesting tidbits is how the `ps` command can show the context in which a process is running under.

.. code:: shell

   % ps -Z -C systemd
   LABEL                             PID TTY          TIME CMD
   system_u:system_r:init_t:s0         1 ?        00:02:18 systemd
   unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 2709 ? 00:00:01 systemd

   # This would show you all running processes, including their contexts.
   # Both formats support the option.
   % ps -efZ
   % ps auxZ

Since processes run under some form of context, they do sometimes have the ability to transition. For example.

.. code:: shell

   # Search for allow rules with the source type of ftpd_t
   # and a target type of public_content_t, and the class name of 'file'
   % sesearch -A -s ftpd_t -t public_content_t -c file
   Found 2 semantic av rules:
      allow ftpd_t public_content_t : file { ioctl read getattr lock open } ;
      allow ftpd_t non_security_file_type : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ;

One sort of uncommon, but clever piece of SELinux is the idea of SELinux users. An SELinux User has roles. Some users have more than one role. What the role means is defined by policy. Roles dictates what domains (contexts) are possible, including transitioning between roles. Let's take a look at some defaults.

.. code:: shell

   % semanage login -l

   Login Name           SELinux User         MLS/MCS Range        Service
