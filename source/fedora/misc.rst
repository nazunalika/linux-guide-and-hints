Using ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` in Fish
---------------------------------

There are a few issues regarding the lack of ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` for Fish such as `weird LD_LIBRARY_PATH behavior #2456 <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2456>`_ where the developers have stated that they won't add support for it. Putting ``env LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` before a command works, but something like ``set -gx LD_LIBRARY_PATH ... $LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` in your config file does not work as intended. The workaround is to add this *after* your normal set invocation:

.. code-block:: shell

    set -xg LD_LIBRARY_PATH (printf '%s\n' $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | paste -sd:)

The solution credit goes to `lucasb-eyer <https://github.com/lucasb-eyer>`_.

Unable to find ``LibLZMA``
--------------------------

Try installing ``xz-libs`` and ``xz-devel``. For some reason, the maintainers have changed the name from `LZMA Utils to XZ Utils <https://tukaani.org/xz/>`_.

Unable to find ``wxWidgets``
----------------------------

For some reason, for some projects that depend on GTK2, installing ``wxGTK`` isn't sufficient. You also need ``compat-wxGTK3-gtk2`` (and the ``-devel`` packages if necessary).

Update all repositories in the current directory
------------------------------------------------

Two use-cases for this are updating vim plugins or golang packages. `Zarat <https://stackoverflow.com/users/578323/zarat>`_ at StackOverflow suggests this:

.. code-block:: bash

   find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -print -exec git -C {} pull \;

If you are using the Fish shell, you need to quote the brackets, `'{}'`. See `issue #95 <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/95>`_.

YouCompleteMe crashes due to ``libtinfo.so`` version mismatch
-------------------------------------------------------------

As pointed out by pdavydov108 in `YouCompleteMe issue #778 <https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/778#issuecomment-228704671>`_, the fix is to install ``ncurses-compat-libs``. Fedora comes with ``libtinfo.so.6``, however, the version of Clang required by YouCompleteMe has a dependency on ``libtinfo.so.5``. 

KeePassHttp no longer works
---------------------------

If you were using `keepasshttp-connector <https://github.com/smorks/keepasshttp-connector>`_ it is now deprecated in favor of `keepassxc-browser <https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser>`_. Install smorks' `keepassnatmsg <https://github.com/smorks/keepassnatmsg>`_ plugin for compatibility with normal KeePass (instead of KeePassXC).

Disable TCP/IP and use sockets for MySQL
----------------------------------------

On Linux, MySQL will create a socket in a location defined by the ``socket`` variable found in ``/etc/my.cnf``. For example, the value may be ``/usr/lib/mysql/mysql.sock``. However, by default, it will still listen on a TCP port, which may be undesirable if you don't plan on exposing your server to the Internet. Simply add ``skip-networking`` to ``/etc/my.cnf``.

SELinux is preventing ``abrt-action-sav`` from write access on the directory /var/lib/rpm
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are receiving this error or a similar one involving ``dbenv.lock``, it means that your ``/var/lib/rpm`` directory has the wrong SELinux contexts applied to it. Verify this with ``ls -alZ /var/lib/rpm/``. You should see files/directories with the ``var_lib_t`` rather than ``rpm_var_lib_t`` label. This may be the result of `bug #1461313 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1461313>`_ where running ``rpm --rebuilddb`` will set the wrong context on the entire directory. Fix it by running ``sudo restorecon -rv /var/lib/rpm``.

Swapping Desktop Environments
-----------------------------

It is a common question, especially in the IRC channel #fedora on how to remove gnome, after say, installing XFCE or maybe KDE. The one answer that not a lot of people provide (or may not know works) is using ``dnf swap``.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Example: Swapping from GNOME to KDE
   $ sudo init 3
   $ sudo dnf swap @gnome-desktop @kde-desktop

   # Example: Swapping from GNOME to XFCE
   # Note that xfce-desktop does exist, but it is missing a few pieces.
   $ sudo init 3
   $ sudo dnf swap @gnome-desktop @xfce-desktop-environment

This will safely swap the package groups from one to the next, the gnome desktop environment with the kde environment. It is recommended that it is ran in multi-user.target (or init level 3 for those who remember). When the swap is complete, reboot.

Upon logging into XFCE, desktop freezes until you switch to another TTY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have ``FullCompositionPipeline`` enabled in Nvidia settings, you may run into this problem. This is a long standing bug, see `#14950 <https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14950>`_. The solution is to either edit or delete `$HOME/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/displays.xml`. Use a different mechanism for setting up your displays.

Alternative fonts
-----------------

There is a COPR repo called `better fonts
<https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dawid/better_fonts/>`_ which adds an
alternative font stack and adds some settings for font rendering. Whether or
not it's "better" is subjective, but it adds alternatives for fonts like Arial.

Since the project is GNOME based, you will have to make a couple of manual
changes for XFCE.  Go to **Settings** -> **Appearance** -> **Fonts**, change
``Hinting`` to ``Slight`` and ``Sub-pixel order`` to ``RGB``.

Video thumbnails
----------------

If you use XFCE and Thunar, video thumbnails might not work out of the box. You need to install `tumbler-extras` **and** `gstreamer1-libav`. While the latter is not listed as a dependency, it will cause mysterious errors because the thumbnailer uses ffmpeg (libav is a ffmpeg fork) under the hood.

Stop Flatpak Spotify from crashing upon close
---------------------------------------------

You can either use ``flatpak override`` or Flatseal (a GUI application to manage permissions), but simply disable GPU Acceleration (``device=dri``).

statvfs '/run/user/1000/doc' failed: Operation not permitted
------------------------------------------------------------

This diagnostic appears to originate from ``xdg-desktop-portal``.
``/run/user/1000/doc`` has the ``fuse_t`` label and only the owner (not even
root) has access to this directory, i.e it is intended behavior. Therefore you
can safely ignore the warning.
