To my knowledge, the best MinGW distribution is provided by Stephan T. Lavavej
(a Microsoft employee who works on the C++ team) and is available on [his site](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html).
It contains mingw-w64, GCC and binutils, coreutils and several other libraries
and command line utilities (including git). Installation simply requires
extracting to any location and using the provided bat files to open a command
prompt with a preset PATH.

## Why not use WSL?

They serve different purposes. The MinGW distribution contains Windows
**ports** of GCC, coreutils, etc. that run natively on Windows. On the other
hand, WSL attempts to allow you to run native Linux binaries on Windows. WSL2
supposedly uses Hyper-V for virtualization.
